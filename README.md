LibreWolf: Browse With Freedom
------------------------------

This project aims at enforcing privacy and security of Firefox without forking the project.

LibreWolf uses more than 500 privacy/security/performance settings, patches, LibreWolf-Addons (optional) and a cleaned bundle of Firefox (updater, crashreporter and Firefox's integrated addons that don't respect privacy are removed).

**LibreWolf is NOT associated with Mozilla or its products.**

Features
--------

- Updated browser: because this project is not a fork, it is kept updated with the latest Firefox version.
- Extensions firewall: limit internet access for extensions ([firewall-test-feature](#extensions-firewall-))
- IJWY (I Just Want You To Shut Up): embedded server links and other calling home functions are removed ([zero unauthorized connection](#ijwy-i-just-want-you-to-shut-up) by default).
- User settings updates: gHacks/pyllyukko base is kept up to date.
- Settings protection: important settings are enforced/locked within `mozilla.cfg` and `policies.json`, those settings cannot be changed by addons/updates/Firefox or unwanted/accidental manipulation; To change those settings you can easily do it by editing `mozilla.cfg` and `policies.json`.
- LibreWolf-addons: set of optional LibreWolf extensions
- Statistics disabled: telemetry and similar functions are disabled
- Tested settings: settings are performance aware
- ESR and Tor version (LibreWolf TBB Beta)
- Tor LibreWolf-addons: adapted LibreWolf extensions for TBB
- Multi-platform (Windows/Linux/Mac/and soon Android)
- Dark theme (classic and advanced)
- Recommended and *code reviewed* addons list
- Community-Driven
- And much more...

Recommended Addons
------------------
Recommended addons are not bundled and need to be installed manually

- [Cookie Master](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookiemaster/): Block all cookies and only allow authorized sites
- [First Party Isolation](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/first-party-isolation/): Enable/Disable FPI with the click of a button

  - Privacy / Fingerprint / Randomize Canvas Fingerprint
  - Privacy / Fingerprint / 100% Randomize ALL Fingerprint Hash
  - Firewall / Experimental / Block SVG getBBox and getComputedTextLength

```
Reviewing Extensions Code
-------------------------
Recommended extensions code have been reviewed for potential unwanted behaviour... reviewed version are available under [extensions](https://github.com/LibreWolf-Browser/LibreWolf/tree/master/extensions) directory.

Extensions Firewall
-------------------
**Extensions Firewall - Description**

*This is a test experiment feature and it is disabled by default !!!* A new section `Extensions Manager` is added to manage addons globally (and addons networking in the subsection `Extensions Firewalling`). Firewalling the network for addons is doable, but it requires a considerable amount of additional work in LibreWolf to make it usable through a button or in a per addon basis (this may or may not be added in a future version, it also could be abandoned as it is a test feature). Currently you can block a list of domains or block the whole network for all the extensions.

**Extensions Firewall - The Settings**

Available native network restriction settings for addons:

- Restricted domains list: `extensions.webextensions.restrictedDomains` this is a list of restricted domains that will be used to block some hosts for all the extensions, Firefox uses this setting to block extensions from accessing mozilla's domains/sites, by default in LibreWolf this setting is set to allow extensions to access all the web (You can edit that list to match your needs or to block a specific domain, note that the domain name has to be 'exact' (for instance facebook.com will only block facebook.com not mobile.facebook.com)
- Content security policy: `extensions.webextensions.base-content-security-policy` and `extensions.webextensions.default-content-security-policy` the later settings can be redefined/changed within an extension so it's not efficient for a firewall purpose. CSP settings are used in Firefox as an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement to distribution of malware; In short: CSP settings block and allow certain domains under certain circumstances and thus could be used to firewall the extensions ([CSP Documentations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP), its [sources code](https://code.compassfoundation.io/general/mozilla-central/commit/623a4f866576815dfcbab26323d13b7144806bdf?view=inline&w=1) and [implementation](https://github.com/mozilla/gecko/blob/central/toolkit/components/extensions/ExtensionPolicyService.cpp))

**Extensions Firewall - Blocking A Domain**

Edit the restricted domains setting as follow under the `about:config` page:

- Restricted Domains Setting: `extensions.webextensions.restrictedDomains` Value: `ExactDomains1,ExactDomains2,ExactDomains3` etc.

**Extensions Firewall - Blocking The Network**

To enable the feature and block the network for all the extensions open `mozilla.cfg` search for `Enable-Firewall-Feature-In-The-Next-Line` and remove the `//` in the next line.

Note that this will block the network access for all the extensions and a lot of extensions needs to be connected in order to work. In the current version of LibreWolf you can block the network for all the extensions or allow it for all of them, a future version may provide additional features like "per addon" setting (By default LibreWolf allows networking for extensions).

**Extensions Firewall - More Infos**

Check `debug-notes.log` for additional info about future version and researches about the subject. Also check [CSP Documentations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP), its [sources code](https://code.compassfoundation.io/general/mozilla-central/commit/623a4f866576815dfcbab26323d13b7144806bdf?view=inline&w=1) and [implementation](https://github.com/mozilla/gecko/blob/central/toolkit/components/extensions/ExtensionPolicyService.cpp).

IJWY (I Just Want You To Shut Up)
---------------------------------
This is a set of settings that aim to remove all the server links embedded in Firefox and other calling home functions in the purpose of blocking un-needed connections. The objective is zero unauthorized connection (ping/telemetry/Mozilla/Google...).

Changelog
---------
Available in the [releases page](https://github.com/LibreWolf-Browser/LibreWolf/releases)

Installation Instructions
--------------------------
**Notice:** in the current state of the project LibreWolf is a set of configuration files for Firefox (awaiting a correct build of the project), therefore if you already have a Firefox profile, that profile will be used and temporary files will be removed (cookies and current session), make sure to backup your current Firefox's profile before using LibreWolf.
Using LibreWolf simultaneously with Firefox is possilbe through a different profile you can follow [this wiki](https://www.ghacks.net/2008/05/29/run-multiple-firefox-profiles-simultaneously/) to do so. **[Future](https://github.com/LibreWolf-Browser/LibreWolf/issues/55) LibreWolf version** will be independent from Firefox and therefore will solve this issue.

Edit Locked Settings
--------------------
Just edit `mozilla.cfg`, save and restart LibreWolf.

Browser Tests - Security/Fingerprint
------------------------------------
Firefox 60 and `privacy.resistFingerprinting` are relatively new, please give it some time to be more widely used and thus less finger-printable; If you are using a different site to analyze your browser make sure to read and understand what the test is about.

```

Cookies Settings
----------------
Using different web services without cookies is impossible and cookie settings in a browser are very important when it come to privacy, in LibreWolf the settings are locked to avoid unwanted changes in such an important setting, but they can be easily changed in `mozilla.cfg` under `User Settings: Cookies settings`.

Tracking Protection
-------------------
Firefox now integrates a tracking protection feature (based on disconnect.me) it's a small content blocking list, the listing can not be edited, this feature is disabled in LibreWolf. It's recommended to use uBlock Origin instead. This feature is disabled:

- Until it evolves and integrates at least list editing.
- Because double filtering (this + ublock) is not suitable for performance.

You can however easily enable this feature in `mozilla.cfg` under `User Settings: Track Protection` (just comment active lines with `//` or remove the entire section).

Comparing Changes And Updates
-----------------------------
If you want to compare changes over updates or if you already have a `user.js`/`mozilla.cfg`/`policies.json`. consider using [Compare-UserJS](https://github.com/claustromaniac/Compare-UserJS), it's an amazing tool to compare user.js files and output the diffs in detailed breakdown, developed by gHack's very own resident cat, [claustromaniac](https://github.com/claustromaniac) :cat:

Usage: If not on windows install [PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) then (for example) `pwsh Compare-UserJS.ps1 mozilla.cfg user.js` (Warning that PowerShell connects to Microsoft sometimes).

Documentation
-------------

**Mozilla.cfg**: Locking and defaulting LibreWolf settings for security, privacy and performance.

**Policies.json**: Policies for enterprise environments (the settings available with `policies.json` are limited right now because this is a new feature of Firefox).

**Bench diff**: Impact on the performance of LibreWolf, it can be a gain or a loss of performance +100/5000 stand for 2% gained performance and -1500/5000 stand for -30% performance loss.

**lockPref**: Locked preference can not be changed by extensions or updates, they can only be changed in `mozilla.cfg`.

**Section**: Description of the settings section separated by ">>>".

**Defaulting VS Enforcing**: Defaulted settings can be changed by the user or an extension if permitted within the browser while enforced settings are locked and can not be changed within the browser, enforced settings can be changed in `mozilla.cfg`.

**About:config**: http://kb.mozillazine.org/About:config_entries.

LibreWolf Dark Theme
-------------------
LibreWolf provides a classic dark theme extension ([LibreWolf Dark Theme](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/LibreWolf-dark-theme/)) but also a purified version of ShadowFox available under [dark-theme directory](https://github.com/LibreWolf-Browser/LibreWolf/tree/master/dark-theme) to install it just copy the directory chrome to your LibreWolf profile directory and then restart LibreWolf, this will expand the dark theme to internal pages like settings pages.

Tuning LibreWolf
---------------

**Restart Button**

One simple solution is to bookmark `about:restartrequired` or `about:profiles` ... when restart is needed open that page and click "normal restart". You can even go further and add the bookmarks links to your icons bar and rename the link to an empty text (you will then have a direct icon to `about:profiles` and a 2 clicks restart).

![capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6892180/48963055-bd914000-ef82-11e8-8ea4-a58e56f5c4a4.png)
...

**Alternative Dark Theme**

<a href="https://github.com/overdodactyl/ShadowFox" target="_blank"><img height=80px src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/overdodactyl/ShadowFox/master/.github/Screenshots/header.png"></a>

**Linux Fix Text Colors**

On Linux when using a dark desktop theme LibreWolf could display white text over white background or black text on black input on some sites or addons, this is fixed in LibreWolf with `lockPref("ui.use_standins_for_native_colors", true);`.

If `ui.use_standins_for_native_colors` is not enough to fix everything you can fix this issue with an other additional solution by using the following values in `about:config` (you need to have Adwaita theme installed) [more details](https://github.com/DmitriK/darkContrast#text-contrast-for-dark-themes) (Note that this is not needed with the default LibreWolf settings as it is already fixed)
```
widget.content.allow-gtk-dark-theme;false
widget.chrome.allow-gtk-dark-theme;false
widget.content.gtk-theme-override;Adwaita:light
```

Tor Compatibility
-----------------
We do not recommend connecting over Tor on LibreWolf classic version (because of the missing LibreWolf-Tor-Addons, they are only included in the tor version for obvious reasons), use instead LibreWolf-Tor version if your threat model calls for it, or for accessing hidden services (Thus said tor settings have been enabled since v2 on all LibreWolf versions for user toriffying/proxifying their entire connection).

Currently LibreWolf-TBB is in beta test, Tor compatibility may change.
